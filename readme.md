# Chaos Game in Vanilla JS
The chaos game is a famous mathmatical algorithm that generates fractals by plotting random dots inbetween initial set points on a canvas. The Sierpiński's Triangle is a fractal of equilateral traingles based on three points, other fractals can be made using different shapes (polygons) with more points. I did this here using the HTML5 canvas and plain vanilla JS (no libraries).
