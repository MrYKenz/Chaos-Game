# Chaos Game in Vanilla JS
The chaos game is a famous mathmatical algorithm that generates fractals by plotting random dots inbetween initial set points on a canvas. There are options here to create a sierpiński's Triangle, a fractal of equilateral traingles based on three points, or a square with fractals plotted against four points. More points can be used to create fractals of different polygons/shapes. I did this using the HTML5 canvas and plain vanilla JS (no libraries).
